Welcome to the ***Health Insights Report***, where we embark on a journey to explore key indicators of healthcare access and outcomes across the globe. Through a series of **interactive visualizations**, we delve into the relationship between **Deliveries in Health Facilities**, **Life Expectancy**, **GDP**, and more, shedding light on the complexities of healthcare provision and its impact on **population health.**

## **Population Dynamics**

Our first stop is a ***line chart***, that traces the evolution of **population** over **time**, allowing us to observe trends & variations across different **countries**. By examining how populations have changed over years, we gain valuable insights into the **growth rates**, **demographic shifts**, & **challenges** faced by nations in managing **populations** effectively.

```{r fig.cap= "***Fig 1: Population Dynamics*** | As depicted in the line chart, **India** and **China** has a continuous growth in the **populations**."}

options(scipen = 999)
timeseries_plot <- data_join %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = Population, color = country)) +
  geom_line() +
  guides(color = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Population Dynamics",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Population",
    color = "Country"
       ) +
  theme_classic()

ggplotly(timeseries_plot)
 
```

## Mapping Global Health Facility Deliveries

Next, we take a ***global*** perspective with an interactive **map** showcasing **deliveries in health facilities** across **countries**. Through this visual exploration, we uncover geographical patterns and disparities in **healthcare** access, highlighting regions where access to essential services may be limited and where efforts for improvement are needed.

```{r fig.cap= "***Fig 2: Global Health Facility Deliveries Map*** | The map depicts the number of **Deliveries in  a Health Facility** on the basis of various **countries** across the world. Countries in **grey** have no data due to a **mismatch** with their names"}

map_world <- (map_data("world"))

single <- unicef_indicator_2 %>%
  select(Deliveries_in_a_Health_Facility, country, time_period) %>%
  filter(time_period == 2015)

map_data_join <- left_join(map_world, single, by = c("region" = "country"))

map_vis <- map_data_join %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill = Deliveries_in_a_Health_Facility)) +
  geom_polygon() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "maroon", na.value = "grey") +
  labs(
    title = "Global Deliveries Map for year 2015",
    subtitle = "Countries in grey have no data due to a mismatch with their names",
    x = "Longitude",
    y = "Latitude",
    fill = "Deliveries_in_a_Health_Facility"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

ggplotly(map_vis) 

```

## Global Snapshot: Deliveries in Health Facilities vs. GDP per Capita

Now we explore the impact of **GDP** on **deliveries in health facilities** for different **countries**, examining how **economic factors** influence **healthcare** **access** and **utilization**. Through this analysis, we uncover socioeconomic disparities in **healthcare** **provision** and identify opportunities for investment and improvement in **healthcare** **infrastructure**.

```{r fig.cap= "***Fig 3: Deliveries in Health Facilities vs. GDP per Capita*** | The ***scatter plot*** depicts the **Deliveries in a Health Facility** on the basis of **GDP per Capita** of different **countries** for the **year 2020**, where **Luxembourg** has the highest **deliveries in a health facilities**."}

scatter_plot<- data_join %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x= Deliveries_in_a_Health_Facility, y= GDP_per_capita, color = country)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, size=2) +
  guides(color = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Maternal Health vs GDP per Capita in 2020",
    x = "Deliveries in a Health Facility",
    y = "GDP per Capita",
    color = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

ggplotly(scatter_plot)

```

## Global Leaders in Maternal Health: Top 15 Countries by Health Facility Deliveries

This ***bar chart*** illustrates the **top 15 countries** ranked by **deliveries in healthcare facilities**. It offers a snapshot of **maternal healthcare access** across different **nations**, aiding in comparative analysis and highlighting disparities. The Top 3 countries by **Health Facility Deliveries** are:

1.  **China**
2.  **Estonia**
3.  **Brazil**

```{r fig.cap= "***Fig 4: Top 15 Countries by Health Facility Deliveries*** | This ***Bar chart*** shows the **Top 15 countries** in terms of **Deliveries in a Health Facility**, and **China** tops the world, with **Estonia** and **Brazil** in the ***2nd*** and ***3rd*** place respectively. "}

deliveries_2000<- data_join %>%
  filter(year == 2020)
deliveries_by_country <- deliveries_2000 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(total_deliveries = sum(Deliveries_in_a_Health_Facility)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_deliveries))
top_countries <- head(deliveries_by_country, 15)

bar_chart <- top_countries %>%
ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, -total_deliveries), y = total_deliveries, fill = country)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 15 Countries by Total Deliveries in Health Facilities from 2000-2020",
    x = "Country",
    y = "Total Deliveries",
    fill = "Country"
  ) +
  theme_classic()

ggplotly(bar_chart)

```

## Conclusion

As we conclude our journey through the ***Health Insights Report***, we reflect on the rich tapestry of **data and insights** uncovered. From trends in **healthcare** **access** to the impact of **economic factors** on **health outcomes**, our exploration has provided valuable insights into the complex interplay of factors shaping **population health** worldwide. Armed with these insights, we are better equipped to inform policy decisions, allocate resources, and drive positive change in **healthcare delivery** for the benefit of all.
